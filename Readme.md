  4. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
  5. perimeter
  6. area
  7. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
  8. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
  9. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
  10. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
  11. symmetry
  12. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
